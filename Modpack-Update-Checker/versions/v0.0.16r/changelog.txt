📢 Update v0.0.16

⚠️ Important Warning
Any version above v0.0.13 is NOT compatible with previous worlds due to world generation mod changes.
If you update an old world, it will corrupt your saves. Please create a new world when updating.
(This is the last time I promise… hopefully.)

This update fixes several issues with world generation in the End, Nether, and Twilight Forest.
👉 I recommend deleting your old End, Nether, and Twilight Forest dimension files for a smoother experience.

📝 About This Update

Added new Nether ambient sounds.
Added new player animations.
Fixed particles (like water splashes) appearing transparent/invisible in first-person with Euphoria Patches shaders.

You now need a calendar to see detailed seasonal info.
